# CS_DotNet6_IMGUI
A research  project in .Net 6 using Veldrid, ImGuiNET and VS Code.
<br/>

**Editing UI Layouts:**<br/>
To edit the GUI layouts currently I am working inside the "GuiLayouts.cs" located under "./src/UI/GuiLayouts.cs".
<br/>

**Currently learned how to:**<br/>
- Render UI.
- Utalize a debug window if arg "--debug" is provided.
- Detect inputs, in this case if tab is pressed, down or released.
- Create menu bars at the top of the page.
- Create new windows with content in it.
